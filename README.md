<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h3>I am a Japanese student aiming to become a Embedded Software Developer in the future!<br></h3>

Since elemetary school, I have been interested in Information Technology, such as building computers, installing Linux OS to super old Windows PCs and Network Security.
Also, I have always loved to think about the logic of things(e.g human emotions and machine mechanisms).
Currently, I would like to become someone who can develop technology that utilizes IoT, which is used by everyone, such as in automoviles or home appliances.

<h4>Why Russian language?</h4>

Because I graduated a brach school of the Fareastern Federal University(Дальневосточный Федеральный Университет) in Hokkkaido. 
At the moment, I study at a technical colledge and my current speciality is IT, but previously I studied Russian regionology and Russian language.
